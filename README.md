# react-ag-grid-starter

Basic example of using React AG Grid, vs Handson table.


## Thoughts

- spreadsheet-like to replace conventional forms
- allow bulk update of resources
- can this be paired with json schema?
- how to import/export data through CSV?
- instead of fetching data from server, this could also be used to just upload data by importing CSV. The view to display server data could be in another display.
